# odin-recipes

Odin-recipes will be a simple bare-bones website with recipe links. This website will be a simple exercise in basic html. It will demonstrate my ability to create a main page with various links. I will be practicing creating good habits with my commits and becoming comfortable with balancing the use of the command line and Visual Studio.
